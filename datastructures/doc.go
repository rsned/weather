/*
Package datastructures contains the basic data types used. The main goal is to store
data in a straighforward unified manner to make it easier to use the data once it is
ingested.  (e.g., Converting all units to SI standards, time shifting to use UTC for
all datapoints so the user doesn't have to figure out forward and backward timezone
offsets themselves.)
